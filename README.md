> **AeroDesk**

AeroDesk is a lightweight hand-gesture control system that lets you perform desktop actions using only your hand in front of a webcam. You can map your own gestures, choose what action they trigger, and use a pinch-and-drag gesture to move windows or interact with the screen.

This project includes:

- A web interface for training, organizing, and mapping gestures

- A real-time recognition engine

- Custom gesture training using your webcam

- Configurable desktop actions

- Pinch-and-drag cursor control
